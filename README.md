# pioneer-project-v1
Alpha pioneering (haha) copy of a site to track tournament results and metagame for Magic: the Gathering Pioneer format play at the Game Grid Lehi store.

This is a rough draft to practice and apply techniques learned in study of HTML/CSS/JS course (TheOdinProject) as well as conceptualize form and scope of project.
